This project exists because I don’t like it when GitHub project links lead to a 404 after removing the project name from the URL.
So I created this as a placeholder. Maybe one day I’ll turn it into a real website — for now, it’s just for fun.

If you want to create your own simple GitHub Homepage:

1) Name your repository like this: "yourusername.github.io"

2) Go to "Settings" → "Pages"

3) Select a branch (e.g., "main") and a folder (I used "/docs")

4) Wait a few seconds for your website to go live at https://yourusername.github.io

Note: Please ignore the commit history in this project. It is a lie.
